                <p>
                    A luau is one of the best experiences you can have on your Hawaiian Islands visit. It features lively Hawaiian music and cultural performances from Hawaii. You will also discover the traditional dishes of Hawaiian feasts. But don’t worry, Our Luau at the Coral Center on Oahu is very suitable for vegans and vegetarians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1819, Hawaii’s first luau-like feast was held. The kapu system, which combined religion, restrictions and management of resources, had been in place before 1819. It was used to separate men from women during mealtimes and celebrations. These feasts can also be called ahaaina and paina. However, over time the name luau, a reference the many delicious dishes made with taro leaves, became a common one.

                <p>
                    Lulu celebrations are continuing to be enjoyed two centuries later. It is worth noting that, despite its Hawaiian origins and the luau’s name, not all entertainment or food at a luau is Hawaiian. The multi-cultural diversity of Hawaii’s luau is evident in the current event. The food served at family luaus is just as varied as the branches of your family tree. A visitor luau may feature dances or music from Polynesian culture.

                    Ancient Hawaiians enjoyed special occasions by gathering with family and friends to feast. King Kamahameha, who reigned in the 1800s and named the event “luau”, and made it more celebratory by lifting some of the religious taboos which prevented women and men from sharing the meal.

                <p>
